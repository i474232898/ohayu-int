# Deferred Execution Helper (NestJS)

A lightweight helper (mini-library) for convenient **deferred execution of code** on another server.

---

## Requirements

- **Environment:** NestJS  
- **Message broker:** e.g. RabbitMQ (the choice of broker is not critical)

---

## Capabilities

- Invoke any class (provider) registered in the Nest container (anything declared in your modules).
- Pass arbitrary data (e.g., `id`, `newName`) to the execution context.

---

## Example Usage
- to register a provider that need's to be called, add a string alias to it:
```ts
  @Module({
  imports: [RemoteMethodModule],
  controllers: [RmqController],
  providers: [
    DeferredExecutorService,
    UserRepository,

    { provide: 'UserRepository', useExisting: UserRepository },
  ],
})
export class WorkerModule {}
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing

```bash
# Start the services
docker-compose up

# Test the deferred execution
curl http://localhost:3000/demo/user123/JohnDoe

# Check logs of Producer: "...Sending message to queue:..."
# Check logs of Consumer: "...Invoking UserRepository.update with args:..."
```
